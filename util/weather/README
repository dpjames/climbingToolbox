The files in this folder are a pipeline to
1. wscrub.py --  download the weather data
2. toGeoJson.py -- format the weather data into a geojson
3. cleanWeather.py -- prepare the data to be turned into a shapefile

The pipeline looks like this:
wscrub.py outputs "outfile"
toGeoJson.py outputs "outfile.geojson"
cleanWeather.pu outputs "weather.geojson"

Then run 

ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" -a_srs EPSG:4326 ../../gis/weather/weather.shp weather.geojson

to convert it into a shape file for use with geoserver and the website.
